ABOUT THIS APPLICATION

This is designed to be used to be a simple Statistics Calculator to calculate the
mean, mode, and median of a set of numbers inputed via the input box, separated by
commas.  

The original concept of this application was originally built for the Charleston 
Southern University class CSCI 325 by Professor Julie Henderson.

Then the GUI was built and there was a revamp of all the code including dozens 
of additions for this free release version.
